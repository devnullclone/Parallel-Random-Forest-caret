# Parallel-Random-Forest-caret
This is my model for a parRF classification problem in R.
It is not meant to be run in totality. 
It is meant to be run --> line by line, inspecting and analyzing the data as you go. 

For more information on the caret package, go here:

Here is a "Practical Tutorial on Random Forest and Parameter Tuning in R". I did not use their methodology for my model, 
but the first 4/5 of the tutorial is great for learning the basics of random forest decision trees.

peace and love - scott
